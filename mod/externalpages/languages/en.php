	<h3>Plataforma de econom&iacute;a colaborativa para la movilidad entre Espa&ntilde;a y Senegal</h3>
	<h5>Project reference: TIC11-2015</h5>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class='western'>The aim of the project is to encourage the mobility migration based on concepts of collaborative and participatory economy consumption. Specifically a web site and a mobile app system will promote the concept of carsharing but based on migration flows between Spain and Senegal (constant migratory flows that exist in reality). The conclusions drawn in this project allows us to apply and adapt this product to other routes between Europe and Africa too.</p>
	<p class='western'>Is part of this project the company Acento Communication which has a multidisciplinary team in close contact with the Senegalese community of Granada. </p>
